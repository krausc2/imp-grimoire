Grimoire (Community Edition) is a Free and Open Source GRC utility for measuring compliance against security frameworks, such as the **ACSC Essential 8, NIST 800, and ISO/IEC 27001.**

It can be used standalone as a project management tool, or eventually with a companion scanner for automated system testing.
